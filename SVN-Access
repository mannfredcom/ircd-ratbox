The ircd-ratbox subversion repository is available for anonymous access.

The stable tree(3.0.x) is at:

svn co http://svn.ratbox.org/svnroot/ircd-ratbox/branches/RATBOX_3_0

Or if you prefer the bleeding edge stuff:

svn co http://svn.ratbox.org/svnroot/ircd-ratbox/trunk

Of course at any given time the SVN tree could be broken.  If you are
planning on using the SVN tree you very well may want to be on the mailing
list, you can subscribe at:

http://lists.ratbox.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ircd-ratbox

Direct bug reports to: http://bugs.ratbox.org
